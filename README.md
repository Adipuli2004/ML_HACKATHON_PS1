Submission for IIT BBS ML hackathon PS1

Problem Statement: 
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases among women globally.Early detection is crucial for improving treatment outcomes and reducing mortality rates. In this project, the goal is to develop a machine learning solution that can accurately classify breast tumors as either malignant or benign based on a dataset of real-valued features extracted from cell nuclei.
